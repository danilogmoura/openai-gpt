# OpenAI GPT Basics for Refinement

This repository contains resources for learning the basics of OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language model, with the aim of refining your understanding of the model.

## Getting Started

To get started with learning the basics of GPT, we recommend following the below steps:

1. Read the original paper on GPT: ["Improving Language Understanding with Unsupervised Learning"](https://cdn.openai.com/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf).
2. Explore the pre-trained GPT models and their specifications: [OpenAI's GPT Models](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/gpt).
3. Experiment with GPT-3 Playground: [GPT-3 Playground](https://beta.openai.com/playground).
4. Try out some GPT-based projects and code examples: [Awesome GPT-3](https://github.com/elyase/awesome-gpt3).

## Resources

This repository also contains additional resources to help refine your understanding of GPT. These resources include articles, tutorials, and code repositories that will deepen your understanding of the model.
